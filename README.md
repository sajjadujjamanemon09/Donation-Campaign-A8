Within this project, I've categorized donations into four distinct types: Health, Food, Clothing, and Education. To organize and navigate through this project, I've set up four paths: /home, /donation, /statistics, and /donations.id.

Here are the project features listed:

1. Fixed Navbar with Active Page Indication:
    Create a fixed navigation bar that remains visible when navigating between different pages (/home, /donation, /statistics).
    Implement a visual indicator to show the active page, such as changing the color of the active button.Home button turns red when on the home pageSame as other page too.


2. Dynamic Banner with Search Bar:
    Design a banner section with a search bar on the home page (/home).
    Allow users to search for donations by category (Health, Food, Clothes, Education) in real-time.
    Implement dynamic filtering to display only donations matching the search query.


3. Donation Card List on Home Page:
    Create a list of 12 donation cards on the home page, each displaying a picture, category, and title.
    Enable users to click on a donation card to view its details.


4. Donation Details Page:
    Develop a donation details page (/donations.id) to display the selected donation's picture, title, description, and a dynamic donate button.
    Implement donation tracking to prevent multiple donations of the same item.
    Show a successful toast when user donated.
    Show a warning toast when attempting to donate an item already donated.
    Limit users to donate 12 items for 12 times.


5. Donated Items List Page:
    Create a page (/donation) to list all donated items, including their pictures, categories, titles, prices, and view details buttons.
    Add a "See More" button to display additional donated items if there are more than 4, and hide the button when clicked.


6. Donation Statistics Page:
    Develop a statistics page (/statistics) that displays a pie chart representing donations against the total donations.
    Calculate and display the percentage of donations made based on the user's contributions.
    Update the pie chart dynamically as users make more donations.
    These features provide a comprehensive overview of your project's functionality, from navigation and search to donation tracking, statistics visualization, and user interface enhancements.
